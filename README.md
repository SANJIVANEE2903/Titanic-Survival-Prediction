# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction – Task 1

This is **Task 1** of my **Data Science Internship at CODSOFT**.

## 📌 Objective
Build a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, gender, passenger class, etc.

## 📊 Dataset
Kaggle Titanic Dataset: [Click here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

## 🔍 Steps Performed
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
